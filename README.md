# Juggling

This is an example that allows you to visualize juggling. It contains device
firmware that exposes an accelerometer service, and a web application that
finds all devices with this service and plots accelerometer data to a graph.
This way you can juggle with multiple devices and see the juggling happen
live on your phone!
